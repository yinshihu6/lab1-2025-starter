Instructions for docker desktop installation
----------------------------------------------
System requirements:
 - windows os 10 pro with enterprise/education
 - macOS >= 10.13 
 
### Download docker app
We are going to use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) app for this lab 
(install it to the default path the installer suggests (*e.g.,* C drive for Windows) to avoid volume mounting issues)

Please download the latest release of the docker app 
  - [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    - *if there is "error on known virtual box bug" while starting your docker, please follow the instructions 
      [here](http://biercoff.com/how-to-fix-docker-machine-installation-on-mac-os-x/) to fix*
  - [windows 10 pro](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) 
    - *if you have not enabled virtualizaiton in your machine before, please manually 
    [turn on virtualization via BIOS settings](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968)*
  - After installation, make sure that your docker is running
